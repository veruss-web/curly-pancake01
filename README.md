# MIEFLOW POS (Mie-kelar)

Point-of-sale and store-management dashboard for noodle shops, cafés and other small businesses.
Built with **Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript and Supabase**.

> Private project · version 0.2.0 · see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

- Overview: live sales chart (today / 7 / 30 days against the previous period), best sellers, restock list and recent sales
- Cashier (Kasir): searchable catalog, order ticket, customer picker, cash (with quick amounts and change) / e-wallet / ATM payment, receipt sheet with thermal printing (58 mm / 80 mm)
- Products, categories and customers (create, edit, delete), product photos in Supabase Storage
- Inventory with conflict-safe stock adjustments (an adjustment never overwrites a sale made on another device)
- Transaction history with filters, sorting, pagination and order detail
- Analytics: revenue trend, top products, category breakdown, custom periods
- Customer order targets and fulfilment tracking
- Notification center (persisted per user), universal search, responsive layout for phone, tablet and desktop
- Multi-user: every record has an `owner_id`; Row Level Security keeps each account's data private

## Technology

| Layer | What the code actually uses |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 13.5 (App Router), React 18 |
| Language | TypeScript (strict) |
| Backend | Supabase: Auth, PostgreSQL with RLS, Storage, Realtime |
| Styling | Hand-written CSS in `app/globals.css` (no CSS framework is loaded) |
| Animation / icons | Framer Motion, Lucide |
| Charts | Inline SVG (no chart library) |
| Tests | Node's built-in test runner (no extra packages) |
| CI | GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) |

The unused shadcn/ui kit and its npm packages (Radix, Recharts, Zod, React Hook Form, …) and Tailwind have been removed: only 16 packages are left in `package.json`.

## Quick start

1. Install Node.js 20 or 22 and create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project.
2. In the Supabase **SQL Editor** run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql). It is idempotent and also safe on an existing project.
3. Copy the environment template and fill in the values of the **same** Supabase project:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
4. Install and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
   ```
5. Create an account on the login screen. The first screen is empty until you add products.

## Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Development server (regenerates the dark theme first) |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build / serve |
| `npm run theme:build` | Regenerate `app/dark-theme.generated.css` from `globals.css` (also runs before `dev` and `build`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | `next lint` |
| `npm test` | Unit tests for the pure business logic in `lib/` |
| `npm run verify` | Typecheck, lint, tests and build in one go |

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | Project URL of your Supabase project |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | yes | Publishable (anon) key of the same project |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORE_NAME`, `_ADDRESS`, `_PHONE`, `_FOOTER` | no | Store profile printed on receipts |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | no | Public URL, used for page metadata |
| `STRICT_BUILD` | no | `1` makes `next build` fail on TypeScript errors (CI sets it) |

Never commit real credentials. `.env.local` is git-ignored.

## Quality gates

- `npm run verify` is the release gate; CI runs the same checks on Node 20 and 22.
- By default a Vercel deploy is **not** blocked by type errors (`STRICT_BUILD` unset). Once `npm run verify` is green,
  set `STRICT_BUILD=1` in the hosting environment so deploys are gated like CI.
- Business logic that is pure (customer targets, fulfilment, formatting) lives in `lib/` and is unit-tested.

## Light / dark theme

Switch with the sun/moon button in the top bar or on the **Settings** page (Light, Dark, Automatic = follow the device). The choice is kept per device and applied
before the first paint, so there is no white flash. `app/globals.css` is the light design; the dark layer is **generated** from it by
`scripts/generate-dark-theme.mjs` into `app/dark-theme.generated.css` (do not edit that file). Hand-written dark tweaks go in `app/dark-overrides.css`.
Give an element the class `keep-light` (or put it under `.theme-preview`) when it must look identical in both themes. A test fails if the generated file is stale.
